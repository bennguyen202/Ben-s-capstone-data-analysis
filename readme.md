The repo is divided into two main folders: pilot and present. Pilot folder contains data, analysis, and figures from Spring 2024. Present folder contains work done during Fall 2024. 

In each folder, there are three main subfolers: analysis, data, and figures. 

Analysis contains the Matlab script used for pulling web data and data analysis, as well as spreadsheets containing the necessary data, including data collected from the chart.
